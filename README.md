Plantify: A Dynamic E-commerce Website
This is Plantify, an academic project I built to demonstrate how to integrate a database with a web application. It was developed using XAMPP's Apache web server and a MySQL database, managed through phpMyAdmin.

How to Run the Project
Place the files: Copy all the project files into the htdocs folder within your XAMPP installation directory.

Import the database: Open phpMyAdmin in your browser, create a new database named Plantify2, Connect the databse by modifying connection code, and then run the SQL code from the provided .sql file.

View the project: After placing the files and importing the database, you can view the project by navigating to the appropriate URL in your web browser (e.g., http://localhost/Plantify2/index.php).

Important Note
Due to a file size limitation on GitHub, I couldn't upload the complete assets folder, which contains many of the images and other large files. Because of this, the website may not function or display correctly. The missing assets are why some features or visuals might appear broken.
